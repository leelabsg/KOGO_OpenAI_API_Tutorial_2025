History of Present Illness:  
78-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and CKD stage 3 who presented with generalized weakness, poor oral intake, and nausea.

Two weeks prior to admission, she was started on metformin after a primary care visit revealed HbA1c of 9.1. Since initiation, the patient has developed persistent loose stools and intermittent abdominal cramping. No reported fever or vomiting. Her family noted a gradual decline in appetite and energy over the past week.

On arrival, vital signs showed hypotension (BP 88/56) and tachycardia (HR 102). Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated creatinine (2.1 from baseline 1.6) and lactic acid of 3.9. Impression was possible metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Metformin was held, and IV fluids were started. Endocrinology was consulted to guide alternative glycemic management. The patient is being monitored for clinical improvement.

Hospital Course:  

# Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis:  
Patient presented with GI symptoms, hypotension, and elevated lactate in the setting of recent metformin initiation and CKD. Suspected MALA. Metformin was held. Initiated IV hydration and bicarbonate support. Mental status and vitals improved over 48 hours.

# T2DM:  
All antihyperglycemics were held initially. Glucose remained stable. Basal insulin will be initiated. Endocrinology is following.

# CKD:  
AKI on CKD with Cr 2.1. Improved with fluids. No indication for dialysis. Electrolytes monitored.

# Hypotension:  
Likely secondary to dehydration and acidosis. Responded to volume repletion.
